"1","R_25Fxlu0sjPOuPXd","It had many images, so it didn't get boring. The message is important","I wasn't really able to relate to anyone","This should include more examples! As well as how to get rid of negative functional thoughts"
"2","R_1Tvt1xrxXKtuZtD","What I likes about this activity is that it shows me what other people said and felt and it relates to me and makes me not feel lonely.","Something I would change about this activity is to have more information about how to love yourself or what can you do instead of talking to there's about that.","N/A"
"3","R_24hJ7a0Eb33jZdc","I like the idea of body neutrality in general.","In the beginning, it asked if you have a disability. Now I wouldn't necessarily say that I have a disability, but I do have JIA which limits what my body can do. A lot of questions asked if I was grateful that my body is as to let me enjoy sports and such, and the problem is that it doesn't, so there's nothing to appreciate. I disagreed with those not because I'm not appreciative of what my body can do but because it doesnt let me do everything.","I think it would be a lot more helpful if it wasn't just a survey if it was an actual program or something."
"4","R_T0BFmDKHjvOGC77","I really liked how it gave you a chance to share your mind to others and your own advice","It would have been cool if there had been a teen who was struggling with body image due to self harm scars and shame from that","No :)"

"9","R_x9ttzC0QhFJrhxD","I like that you can select different stories to look through! I also appreciate that pronouns were included and used accordingly.","Id like a more operational definition of body positivity and body neutrality. I don't think it's as clear as it could be in this activity.","Just include more solid, operational definitions of body positivity and neutrality. For the clarity of the activity's sake! Everything has nuance of course."
"10","R_2rYDnGvYfgqV96g","I like the graphics and the examples to help when I got stuck on what to say","I feel like the examples could be more tailored to our own identity.

"11","R_bgD7XjM97KSw3rb","I like talking about myself So this was fun.","Honestly it felt weirdly cheesy. Like something my school would make me fill out before they sent me to the school shrink.","Nah. Keep it up bois."

I would hope there is a text version or the images have text descriptions.","thank you"
